# Chapter 1

## Random Variable Generation

The chapter begins with an introduction of generalized inverse distribution function methods for generating random variables from any given distribution. Congruential generators and KISS generators for generating random samples are also introduced. Further, transformation methods for generating an arbitrarily distributed random number are described. In particular, the Box-Muller generator is presented, which explores the geometrical properties of the normal distribution. The last section of the chapter describes the accept-reject methods.

The underlying theoretical background of the various methods are explained, and efficient implementation is discussed. All methods are demonstrated with a series of examples and plots. Some of the most important R codes are presented. The chapter ends with a list of problems useful for written exams.
